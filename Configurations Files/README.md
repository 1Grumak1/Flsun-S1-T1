### WHATâ€™S NEW IN THE IMPROVED VERSION?

- Reorganizing configuration files for clarity.
- Added `M600` functionnality (hotend heating stopped after 15min of inactivity).
- Added support for `M106 P3 Sxx` to control Chamber Fan with OrcaSlicer.
- Added `LASER_CALIBRATION` macro.
- Improved Bed Mesh.
- Fixed `UNLOAD_FILAMENT` macro to purge filament before retraction to avoid clogging.
- Fixed filament sensor detection. The pause was carried out as soon as the detector was triggered, which caused a significant loss of filament (approximately 600/650mm).
- Fixed the limitation of Z-Offset. It could only be applied in the range .02 to .05.
- Fixed `CANCEL_PRINT` macro to prevent the hotend from hitting drying box when print is cancelled and hotend is placed at the front of the bed.
- Other minor fixes.

### NEEDED TO TEST

- `M600` functionnality.
- Try lower arc resolution like 0.1 (to see if the machine will be able to support a lower resolution without to crash due to its low RAM).

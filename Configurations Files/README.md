## WHATâ€™S NEW IN THE IMPROVED VERSION?

- Reorganizing configuration files for clarity.
- Added M600 functionnality (Needed to test it).
- Added support for `M106 P3 Sxx` to control Chamber Fan with OrcaSlicer.
- Added `LASER_CALIBRATION` macro.
- Improved Bed Mesh.
- Fixed `UNLOAD_FILAMENT` macro to purge filament before retraction to avoid clogging.
- Fixed filament sensor detection. The pause was carried out as soon as the detector was triggered, which caused a significant loss of filament (approximately 600/650mm).
- Other minor fixes.
